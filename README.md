# ADHD-web-app
My job got recently discontinued and I was looking for an app to help me keep being structured while developing my Javascript skills. I couldn't find one that satisfied my needs. I decided to create one that would regroup useful tools from different apps and add more to make it as easy as possible for people with neurodivergence to get organised


First, I wanted to get a simple scheduling app on web. THis means a sober interface which requires the use of different events to move throught he web page.

The app can so far display each month with paddig boxes for the days that do not belong to the months but appear on them as the beginning or end of the week
Then. I replaced the previous and next button with a possibility to scroll in the vertical axis using a mouse or trackpad. **I did test the trackpad only for now --> check later with a mouse.**

Now, I am going to add the possibility to zoom on a particular week to get the week calendar. The idea would be to create a pinching event. This pinching event will also be used to zoom in to check the day.
